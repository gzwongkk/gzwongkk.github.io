This framework is designed for jump-starting a single-page visual analytics system. It employs Python's Flask server as the backend and Javascript's Vue as the frontend. The framework facilitates fast development with hot-reloads (Vite), UI components (Ant design), state management (Pinia), and type inference (TypeScript). The framework comes with demos to show typical frontend-backend communication, as well as vue components interaction.
