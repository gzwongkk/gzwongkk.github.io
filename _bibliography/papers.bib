  title={Explaining with Examples Lessons Learned from Crowdsourced Introductory Description of Information Visualizations}, 
  abstract={Data visualizations have been increasingly used in oral presentations to communicate data patterns to the general public. Clear verbal introductions of visualizations to explain how to interpret the visually encoded information are essential to convey the takeaways and avoid misunderstandings. We contribute a series of studies to investigate how to effectively introduce visualizations to the audience with varying degrees of visualization literacy. We begin with understanding how people are introducing visualizations. We crowdsource 110 introductions of visualizations and categorize them based on their content and structures. From these crowdsourced introductions, we identify different introduction strategies and generate a set of introductions for evaluation. We conduct experiments to systematically compare the effectiveness of different introduction strategies across four visualizations with 1,080 participants. We find that introductions explaining visual encodings with concrete examples are the most effective. Our study provides both qualitative and quantitative insights into how to construct effective verbal introductions of visualizations in presentations, inspiring further research in data storytelling.},

  abstract={Chinese painting poetry is an extraordinary aesthetic phenomenon in world art history. It is not only part of the paintings but also helps us to better understand the spiritual conception that the artists express. In this paper, we present an interactive visual system to enable ordinary users to compose customized painting poetry for ancient Chinese paintings, which contain three properties: (1) We employ object detection and image captioning to describe the scenery depicted in the painting. (2) We extend the modern color theory to analyze the underlying emotions of each painting. (3) We propose an interactive poetry generation method that takes the content description and the emotional expression to add the diversity of the poetry creation. Several visual components are carefully designed to visualize and contextualize the features in the painting. They effectively guide users to steer the creation of personalized painting poems. We conduct efficient case studies and user interviews to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system.},

  abstract={Tax evasion is a serious economic problem for many countries, as it can undermine the government' s tax system and lead to an unfair business competition environment. Recent research has applied data analytics techniques to analyze and detect tax evasion behaviors of individual taxpayers. However, they failed to support the analysis and exploration of the uprising related party transaction tax evasion (RPTTE) behaviors (e.g., transfer pricing), where a group of taxpayers is involved. In this paper, we present TaxThemis, an interactive visual analytics system to help tax officers mine and explore suspicious tax evasion groups through analyzing heterogeneous tax-related data. A taxpayer network is constructed and fused with the trade network to detect suspicious RPTTE groups. Rich visualizations are designed to facilitate the exploration and investigation of suspicious transactions between related taxpayers with profit and topological data analysis. Specifically, we propose a calendar heatmap with a carefully-designed encoding scheme to intuitively show the evidence of transferring revenue through related party transactions. We demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of TaxThemis through two case studies on real-world tax-related data, and interviews with domain experts.},
